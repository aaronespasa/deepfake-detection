# DeepFake Detection with PyTorch 🧐

The objective of this project is to distinguish between computer-generated (deepfake) and real individuals appearing in a video. However, it is important to note that this project is not optimized for identifying hyper-realistic generated images, but instead primarily focuses on analyzing screenshots taken from a video.

You can try the [deepfake detector](https://huggingface.co/spaces/aaronespasa/deepfake-detection) by uploading a screenshot from a deepfake video (for example from YouTube) and see the results.

## Set-Up Environment 🌲 
### Install the necessary dependencies
1. Install PyTorch and Cuda on a new conda environment ([PyTorch Anaconda commands](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)):
```sh
$ conda create --name pytorch python=3.8
$ conda activate pytorch
$ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

2. Install OpenCV:
```sh
$ pip install opencv-python
$ python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
```

3. Install Numpy, Matplotlib and Tqdm:
```sh
$ conda install -c conda-forge numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

4. Install Albumentations:
```sh
$ pip install albumentations
```

### Download the dataset
If you want to see the arguments that can be passed to download the dataset, run the following command:

```sh
$ python dataset/download.py -h
```

1. Download the FaceForensics++ dataset:
```sh
$ python dataset/download.py data -c c40 -d DeepFakeDetection
$ python dataset/download.py data -c c40 -d DeepFakeDetection_original
```
> Using -c c40 we get the maximum compression to download them fastly.

## Train the model 🛠
```sh
$ python training.py
```

## Roadmap

Binary Image Classifier:

- [x] Extract image frame from the videos.
- [x] Use a MTCNN to detect the faces and create a new dataset.
- [x] Filter the data (remove images which do not contain faces).
- [x] Data Augmentation.
- [x] Weights & Biases integration.
- [x] Binary Image Classifier of DeepFakes using a non-SOTA architecture (ex.: InceptionV3 or ResNet50).
- [ ] Binary Image Classifier of DeepFakes using a SOTA architecture (ex. Vision Transformers).
